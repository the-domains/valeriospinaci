Born in Rome, Valerio Spinaci is the world's first lawyer to be ever admitted to practice law both in Italy and in the United States after passing the bar exam in FL, CA, NY, NJ, and Italy. 

Upon graduating from law school in Italy, Valerio moved to the U.S. and earned a J.D., summa cum laude in Florida. Then, he passed the bar exam in multiple states and after an internship at Hogan Lovells he starts working with the firm Finizio & Finizio, P.A., in Fort Lauderdale focusing on civil litigation, immigration, and business matters with international outreaches.

He is fluent in English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and French.
