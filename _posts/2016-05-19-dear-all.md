Dear all,

After the year starting in such an amazing way, I hope that my Egyptian friends are all doing well, safe and sound after the terrible news we received.

CNN just revealed that an Egyptair flight has gone off radar and has probably crashed with 69 people on board. 

If this tragedy is confirmed, we would like to help in assisting the impacted families. Perhaps you remember from our discussions that our firm has assisted in representing over 150 aviation disaster victims.

I will be traveling to both Paris and Egypt with other members of our firm to meet with family members of victims and their representatives to collaborate with them in seeking justice and maximum compensation. 

Please fee free to communicate with me on my mobile at +1(954)225-0243 should you or your friends or family have a connection with a family affected by this tragedy. 

Sincerely,

Valerio
